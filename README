vcat - video cat
Outputs a video on a 256-color enabled terminal with UTF-8 locale.
Based on icat (image cat by Andreas Textor) and a ffmpeg tutorial.

Build requirements:
ffmpeg (libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat and libswscale)

To compile:
'make'

How to use:
'vcat video.avi' plays video.avi stretched to 80*24 by default.
'vcat -k -w $((COLUMNS)) -h $((LINES)) video.avi' will keep the aspect ratio and
rescale each frame to the size of the terminal.

Since vcat makes use of ffmpeg to play the videos, a bunch of codecs (h264,
MPEG2, Theora, ...) and containers (mp4, mkv, avi, ...) are supported.
There is no sound support yet, and the framerate is not fixed.

Have fun!
